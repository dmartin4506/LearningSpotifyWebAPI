# LearningSpotifyWebAPI
This repo is to store the code and my notes in learning the basics of the Spotify API and NodeJS


this is a personal record of my experience learning the basics of the Spotify Web API and learning to use NodeJS

1) need homebrew installed for ease of access when finding and downloading tools

This will be the walkthrough on utilizing NodeJS through the lens of this API

1) Create a project folder in text editor of choice
2) initialize project with NPM running "run npm init" with the directory open in terminal 
3) complete npm init prompt 
4) attempt to run the code, if it doesnt work go to step 5
5) if package error, need to install them. go to file directory needed, install the package thats being asked for by running:
      ex)     npm install express --save
      ex)     npm install cookie-parser --save 
 
 
from there you should be able to open the local host url running

1) make sure to use the Dev Dashboard to get the client ID and secret
